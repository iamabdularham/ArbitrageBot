# Arbitrage Bot

This project is an **Arbitrage Bot** designed to identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and SushiSwap. The bot continuously monitors live prices, calculates potential profits, and accounts for various factors such as gas fees, slippage, and flashloan fees.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gas Fee Calculation**: Fetches real-time gas prices to ensure accurate cost estimation.
- **Slippage Impact Analysis**: Simulates trades to account for price slippage during transactions.
- **Flashloan Fee Integration**: Includes flashloan fees in profit calculations for accurate net profit estimation.
- **Profit Threshold**: Configurable minimum profit threshold to avoid low-profit transactions.
- **Historical Data Storage**: Logs price and transaction data for trend analysis and debugging.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Sends alerts for profitable opportunities (placeholder for integration with email/Telegram).
- **Transaction Execution**: Placeholder for automating trade execution using Flashbots or private RPC endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Infura Account**: For accessing Ethereum blockchain data.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Installation

   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
     ```env
     INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
     INFURA_SECRET_KEY=your_infura_secret_key
     ```

5. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## Configuration

- **Profit Threshold**: Adjust the minimum profit threshold in `main.py` to filter low-profit opportunities.
- **Trade Amount**: Modify the trade amount in `main.py` to suit your strategy.
- **DEX Support**: Extend the bot to support additional DEXs by adding their contract addresses and ABIs.

## Logging and Historical Data

- **Logs**: All logs are stored in `arbitrage_bot.log` for debugging and tracking.
- **Historical Data**: Price and transaction data are stored in `historical_data.csv` for trend analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-DEX Support**: Add support for more DEXs like PancakeSwap, Curve, or Balancer.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Integrate with email or Telegram for instant alerts.
- **Automated Transaction Execution**: Implement trade execution using Flashbots or private RPC endpoints.
